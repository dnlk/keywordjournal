### Immediate Todos

- This needs to be deployed, so it can be used experimentally in it's current state (use digitalocean?)
- The UI for entering tagged text needs to be designed and implemented (use react?)
- The internal data representations of resources needs to be defined, and all current logic needs to be reimplemented in terms of it.
- Use ORM or do my own thing?
- On the same not, all connection logic needs to be cleaned up to use clear, consistent internal data representations.
- App structure must be defined and utilized. Minimize coupling to Flask and SQLite.
- Standardize time zone?
