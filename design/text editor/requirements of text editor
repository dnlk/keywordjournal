After experimenting with some attempts to make my own text editor, it has become clear that the UI aspect is a daunting
task. The text buffer part of the text editor has been done, however, and can be used if it is useful.

Requirements of a text editor:
- Must be able to report on which cursor position was clicked.
- Must be able to report on the location of the active cursor.
- Must be able to report every time a character (or other object) is entered in the text editor.
- Report when any event happens which changes the state of the editor content, e.g. paste from clipboard.
- Has an API to set styling for specified text selections.
- Can hide WYSIWYG features, e.g. from the toolbar

Other things which would be nice to have:
- Their text buffer is exposed in a way that lets me attach data to it, and retrieve that data (thus making another
  text buffer, such as the one I wrote, unnecessary).
- Insert HTML element in a position in the text editor, which will be rendered.

I looked into a bunch of WYSIWYG editors:

tinymce
ckeditor
summernote
trumbowyg

I got my hands dirty with tinymce. I could kind of do what I needed to do, but it was a fight every step of the way.
You can copy and paste html bits around, which  means that I can probably store some data in those bits. It's not
clear to me how I will get the data I want out of the text editor.

In the end, after days looking into all these text editors, I am left with the feeling that they do not do what I
want them to do, and I am better off trying to implement my own thing.

UPDATE

I looked into implementing my own text editor, and I ran into a lot of edge cases.
- Language specific things, e.g. what constitutes a word
- Copy / paste support for different platforms
- Misc event support on platforms
- Keyboard on mobile
- Cross platform rendering

I came across this blog post, by one of the ckeditor devs:

There are for sure more concerns, but I was convinced enough that I decided it was a bad idea. I decided to go
with ckeditor.
